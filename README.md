**Java Notes App (File I/O Project)**

Project Description

The Java Notes App is a console-based project designed to demonstrate practical usage of File Handling in Java. It allows users to manage their personal notes through a menu-driven interface. Users can create new notes, view existing notes, update them with additional content, and even delete unwanted notes. Each note is stored as a simple .txt file, making the app lightweight and easy to use.

The project is built around the following core Java concepts:

1. File Handling â†’ Using File, FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter to perform operations on text files.

2. Exception Handling â†’ Managing errors gracefully, such as invalid file names or missing files.

3. OOP Basics â†’ Organizing related functionalities into methods (createNote(), viewNote(), updateNote(), deleteNote()) for better modularity and reusability.

4. CLI Input Handling â†’ Using Scanner to interact with users through the command line.

Why this project is useful

1. This project mimics real-world note-taking applications at a basic level, showing how persistent data storage works. It is especially useful for beginners to:

2. Understand how Java programs can interact with the file system.

3. Learn how to design CLI applications with a user-friendly menu.

4. Practice writing clean, modular code following OOP principles.

5. By completing this project, learners gain confidence in handling persistent data storage and file operations, which are key skills for real-world software development.

Project Structure:

      src/
         â”œâ”€â”€ NoteApp.java   # Main class with menu + methods

How It Works:

1. Run the program â†’ menu is displayed.

2. User selects an option (create/view/update/delete/exit).

3. File handling operations are performed in the background.

4. Loop continues until the user chooses Exit.

Features

1. Create and manage notes in plain .txt files.

2. Append new content to existing notes.

3. Delete unwanted notes.

4. Error handling for invalid file names.

5. Menu-driven console interface.
